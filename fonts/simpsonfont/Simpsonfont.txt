Hey there Simpson fans. This font was originally named Ackbar and created in 1996 by a man
named Jon Bernhardt. I have added it in this zip file so he receives full credit. It clones the famous handwriting of
 Matt Groening, father of my favorite show and longest running series, The Simpsons! I have gone back into it and
 added characters that were featured
in the later well recognized logo. (not the one that comes through the clouds at the very beginning of each 
episode.) My hat off to him on a job well done. Only special trick is spelling out "the" in smaller scale by pressing
the asterisk key ( * ). Once again, i DO NOT take credit for this font's creation, only it's remastering. This font as
well as all the others on my site are free for download for non-commercial  use only.check out my graphic archive
